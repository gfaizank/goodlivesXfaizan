# GoodLivesXFaizan

Welcome to the GoodLivesXFaizan project! This guide will help you set up and run the application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm are installed. You can download and install them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- Android Studio is installed and properly configured with an Android Virtual Device (AVD) or connect your physical Android device via USB.
- React Native CLI is installed globally. You can install it by running:

  ```bash
  npm install -g react-native-cli
  ```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gfaizank/goodlivesXfaizan.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd goodlivesXfaizan
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Android Environment

#### For macOS/Linux Users:

Ensure your environment variables for Android SDK are set correctly. Add the following lines to your `.zshrc` (Zsh) or `.bashrc` (Bash) file:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Source the file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

#### For Windows Users:

Set your environment variables through the System Properties -> Environment Variables. Add the following paths to the `Path` variable:

```
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\emulator
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\tools
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\tools\bin
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools
```

### 4. Start Your Android Emulator

Open Android Studio and launch your AVD (Android Virtual Device) from the AVD Manager. Alternatively, you can connect a physical Android device via USB and enable USB debugging from the Developer Options.

### 5. Run the Application

Finally, run the application on your emulator or connected device using:

```bash
npm run android
```

## Additional Information

### Troubleshooting

- **Emulator Issues**: If you encounter issues with the emulator, ensure that your AVD is configured correctly with the appropriate system image.
- **Dependency Issues**: If you face issues during `npm install`, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
- **Android SDK Issues**: Make sure your Android SDK is up to date. You can update it through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.

### Useful Commands

- To start the Metro Bundler:

  ```bash
  npx react-native start
  ```

- To run the application on iOS (macOS only):

  ```bash
  npx react-native run-ios
  ```

- To build the APK for distribution:

  ```bash
  cd android
  ./gradlew assembleRelease
  ```
